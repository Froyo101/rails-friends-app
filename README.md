# Rails Friends App

An app that allows users to create and edit a friends list, developed with Rails and Bootstrap. A hosted demo can be found here: https://rails-friends-app-jfoiles.herokuapp.com/.

This project was created to follow along with a tutorial provided by John Elder for FreeCodeCamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg), all credit goes to him for the app's implementation and general design.
